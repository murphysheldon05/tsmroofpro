# Terminal Command Permissions

When running terminal commands (npm, npx, build, tests, migrations, etc.):

- **Always request full permissions upfront** — Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` or `["full_network"]` so commands execute without prompting the user.
- **Do not ask for permission** — Run commands directly; the user has granted approval.
- **Use semicolons for PowerShell** — On Windows, chain commands with `;` not `&&`.
